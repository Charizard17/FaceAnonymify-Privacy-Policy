    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: October 03, 2023</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      Welcome to FaceAnonymify! This app is provided by Esad Dursun and is
      intended for general use. Your privacy is important to us, and we are
      committed to ensuring that your personal information is treated with care.
      This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use
      our service.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>
      FaceAnonymify <b>does not collect any personal information</b> from its
      users. We do not collect, store, or share any data that can be used to
      identify you.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <p>
      Since we do not collect any personal information, we have no data to use
      or share. The app's functionality is based on processing images that you
      provide from your device. We do not store or transmit any of these images
      to our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Face Detection</h2>

    <p>
      FaceAnonymify uses the
      <a
        href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/data-protection.html"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >AWS - Amazon Rekognition</a
      >
      service for face detection. This service allows us to detect faces in the
      images you provide. However, it is important to note that we do not store
      any images, and the face detection is performed locally on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

    <p>
      Our app may contain links to external websites or services. Please note
      that we do not have control over these external sites and their privacy
      practices. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these websites
      before using them.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      FaceAnonymify is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13.
      We do not collect personal information from children under 13. If we
      discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information,
      we will promptly delete it.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      posted on this page, and the effective date will be updated accordingly.
      We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
    </p>
